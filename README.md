# Starline Config Server
<p>This is just a development config server to centralize all of my project's configurations. I suggest you to prepare docker on you local
machine. You can then deploy MySQL, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ or anything else that you want to learn while using springboot. You won't have to populate properties
on new project, simply import it from the config server. Centralized config make things easier.</p></br></br>

*NOTE* : you can check `config-server` branch to view the source code for the config server itself.
